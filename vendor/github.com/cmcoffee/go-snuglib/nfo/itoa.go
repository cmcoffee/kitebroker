// Package log implements a simple logging package. It defines a type, Logger,
// with methods for formatting output. It also has a predefined 'standard'
// Logger accessible through helper functions Print[f|ln], Fatal[f|ln], and
// Panic[f|ln], which are easier to use than creating a Logger manually.
// That logger writes to standard error and prints the date and time
// of each logged message.
// Every log message is output on a separate line: if the message being
// printed does not end in a newline, the logger will add one.
// The Fatal functions call os.Exit(1) after writing the log message.
// The Panic functions call panic after writing the log message.
