# fin
    import "github.com/cmcoffee/go-fin"

Package fin implements a global defer for the application which is useful for making a clean exit.
Functions such as shutting down databases, closing files, etc..





## Variables
``` go
var (
    // Signal Notification Channel. (ie..fin.Signal<-os.Kill will initiate a shutdown.)
    Collector = make(chan os.Signal)
)
```

## func Defer
``` go
func Defer(closer interface{})
```
Adds a function to the global defer, function must take no arguments and either return nothing or return an error.


## func Exit
``` go
func Exit(exit_code int)
```
Intended to be a defer statement at the begining of main, but can be called at anytime with an exit code.
Tries to catch a panic if possible and log it as a fatal error,
then proceeds to send a signal to the global defer/shutdown handler


## func ExitOn
``` go
func ExitOn(sig ...os.Signal)
```
Sets the signals that we listen for to initiate a global shutdown


## func SetErrorLogger
``` go
func SetErrorLogger(input func(v ...interface{}))
```
Sets function with regard to handling errors generated by the global defer.
